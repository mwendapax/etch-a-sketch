## Your Pixel Art Grid: An Interactive Canvas

This webpage offers a dynamic 16x16 grid of squares built entirely with JavaScript and Flexbox.

**Grid Construction:**

* The grid is constructed dynamically using JavaScript, creating 16 rows and 16 squares within each row.
* Flexbox properties are employed within the CSS to arrange these squares in a neat grid format.

**Interactive Hover Effect:**

* As you hover your mouse over individual squares, they change color, simulating a drawing or painting experience.
* This effect is achieved by attaching event listeners to each square, detecting both mouse entering and leaving events (hovering).

**Dynamic Grid Resizing:**

* A button is provided on the webpage. Clicking this button prompts you to enter a new desired number of squares per side for the grid (with a maximum of 100).
* Upon confirmation, the existing grid is removed, and a brand new grid with the specified size is generated. Importantly, the overall size of the grid container remains consistent.
